Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
This code creates a socket in Python:
socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
The "socket.SOCK_STREAM" argument specifies the type of socket (TCP).

Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?
The client socket used to make requests to a server and receives data from the server

The server socket waits for requests and receives and sends data from/to clients

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
This code instructs the OS to let us reuse the same bind port:
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
We get their (client) address (IP & port)

Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
It receives a close connection which is an empty string
